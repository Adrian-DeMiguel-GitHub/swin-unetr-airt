## ðŸ§  Overview

This thesis introduces and evaluates a novel end-to-end spatio-temporal deep learning framework for detecting internal defects using **Active Infrared Thermography (AIRT)**. The proposed method is based on a **3D transformer architecture (Swin UNETR)**, adapted to process thermal image sequences directly without relying on traditional video-to-image preprocessing techniques.

The codebase also includes a benchmark against a common 2D spatial deep learning approach: **U-Net with a VGG11 backbone**, using **Principal Component Thermography (PCT)** and **Pulsed Phase Thermography (PPT)** for video-to-image preprocessing.

## ðŸ§© Models

### ðŸ”· Proposed Approach: Swin UNETR

- Fully end-to-end 3D spatio-temporal transformer-based segmentation
- Tiled spatial inputs + temporal subsampling
- Two variants tested:
  - **V1**: 3D logit compression at the output
  - **V2**: Temporal compression integrated in skip connections

### ðŸ”¶ Baseline: U-Net VGG11

- 2D segmentation on summary images created with video-to-image processing
- Evaluated using both **PPT** and **PCT**
